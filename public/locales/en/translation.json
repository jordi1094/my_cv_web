  "VeepeeExpirience": "I started my career at Veepee as a photo retoucher, responsible for editing and assembling product images.As I became more integrated with the team, I noticed certain areas within the work processes that could be improved, especially related to organization and time management.\n \nMotivated by this observation, I decided to learn programming to provide more efficient solutions. I started developing a JavaScript script that optimized the planning and organization of the team, which was well-received and helped improve productivity and communication across projects.\n \nThanks to this growth, I now closely collaborate with the tools development team, designing and creating my own solutions to make the team's work easier. This experience has allowed me to expand my technical skills and actively contribute to the continuous improvement of the workflow."
